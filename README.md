# gateplugin-Format_Bdoc

This plugin adds support for loading and saving GATE documents represented as "Bdoc" (BasicDocument)
serialized as JSON or GZIP compressed JSON. This representation and serialization can be exchanged
with the Python `gatenlp` package which is also able to read and write documents that way.


Maven Coordinates:
* groupId: uk.ac.gate.plugins
* artifactId: format-bdoc

NOTE: the Bdoc representation is implemented in the library [gatelib-basicdocument](https://github.com/GateNLP/gatelib-basicdocument)
